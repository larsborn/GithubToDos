# GithubToDos

This Chrome extension enables you to persist ToDos to a list, that is not as volatile as the notification list of 
Github. It only uses the local storage of your browser (which, at least in theory, should also sync through the Google 
cloud to your other devices).

**Warning:** This Software is in version 0.x and my spontaneously catch fire (and burn your marked ToDos in the process, 
it should most probably not destroy your computer). 

## Installation

Please follow instructions under "Developer Installation" until we published the extension on the Chrome Web Store 
(Issue #1).
