# GithubToDos

This Chrome extension enables you to persist ToDos to a list, that is not as volatile as the notification list of 
Github. It only uses the local storage of your browser (which, at least in theory, should also sync through the Google 
cloud to your other devices).

## Installation

Go to
[GithubToDos on the Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githubtodos/pmpgbamabobooepceaoifhhdbibmcind) 
and install the extension as usual.

## Developer Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/larsborn/GithubToDos.git`
* Open [chrome://extension](chrome://extension) in Chrome
* Check "Developer mode" at the top right
* Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the extension folder you just cloned into
